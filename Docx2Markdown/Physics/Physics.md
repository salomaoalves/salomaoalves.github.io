1. # <a name="_j6vfnvecmspz"></a>**Fluid Mechanics**
concerned with the mechanics of fluids and the forces on them

**Perfect Fluid** is defined as that fluid which at rest enjoys the property of isotropy, that is, around a point the forces are equal in all directions. They are fluids without viscosity, density is cst and there is an isotropic state of stress under conditions of motion. They don’t exist in nature.

**Shear Stresses** is the distribution by units of area of a force acting parallel to a given surface. In fluids, create a behavior known as flow ( a continuous deformation).

The fluids that obey the proportionality equation, that is, a linear relationship between the value of the applied shear stress and the resulting deformation velocity (cst μ) are the **Newtonian Fluids** (i. g., water). Fluids that don’t follow the equation are **Non-Newtonian Fluids** (i. g., sedge).

## <a name="_exirlxld92aq"></a>Concepts
**Density** ρ (ró) relationship between mass and volume of a material at a given pressure and temperature.

ρ=mv

**Pressure (Pa)** measures the force applied perpendicularly to a surface.

` `*Earth Atmosphere Pressure = 10⁵ N/m²*

`     `Pe ↓ as climbs upward and Pe ↑ as dive in the lake

P=FA



**Specific** **Weight** γ (gamma) the weight of the volumetric unit.

γ=ρ\*g 	                γ=WV for liquids 

γ=PR\*T for gasses

**Compressibility** is the ability of a body or substance to reduce its volume when it is subjected to pressures in all its parts.

εvol=-V\*ΔPΔV

**Elasticity** is the property of fluid to increase its volume when pressure is reduced.

E=-V\*ΔPΔV

**Capillarity** is the tendency for substance to move up or down the walls of thin tubes or to move in porous materials (napkins, sponges). There are two different forces: Adhesion (attraction of liquids molecules with solids) pulls the liquid molecules closer together than through cohesion pulls the others. Stop when cohesion > adhesion. Works against gravity.

**Surface Tension** is the property of the surface layer exerting tension and is the force required to maintain the unit length of the film in equilibrium.

**Streamline** is the curve whose direction at each point is tangent to the velocity vector of the fluid, thus, it’s possible to visualize the behavior of the fluid during the motion.

**Stationaring (laminar)** flow is obtained when the flow velocity is small, that is, cst flow velocity at all points. *Re<2100-2300.*    Re=ρ\*V\*Dμ where D is the pipe diameter 

**Non-Stationaring (turbulent)** is when the fluid velocity varies over time. Re>4000.

**Viscosity** μ is the resistance that a fluid offers to flow. It can be defined as the internal friction resulting from the movement of one layer of fluid in relation to another one; is who determines the degree of resistance of the fluid to the shear force, that is, to resist deformation.

**Flow** **Rate** measures the amount of fluid that flows inside a given tube of well-defined cross-sectional area.

Q=ΔVΔt

**Masss Discharge** is defined as the amount of mass that passes through the control surface in the unit of time.

Dm=ΔmΔt

**Pressure Velocity/Dynamic** happens when the liquid passes through a point with different areas. Causes hydrostatic pressure to decrease in regions where flow velocity is increased, so kinetic energy (dynamic pressure) must increase at the expense of hydrostatic pressure energy.

## <a name="_u2k3vrgqd4k"></a>General Equation of Perfect Gas
perfect gasses or ideal gasses, is a gas which increase proportionately the temperature and kinetic energy

they obey a particular idealized relationship between pressure, velocity and temperature, called the general law (contains Boyle’s and Charles’ law)

don’t exist in nature - for real gas, only under high temp and low pressure

P\*V=n\*R\*T

`  `R is the universal gas cst R=8.314510 Nm/molK 

n is the number of moles → n=m(total mass)M(molecular mass of gas)

says that the increase of pressure exerted at any point within an ideal liquid in equilibrium is transmitted integrally to all point contained in the liquid and to the walls![](Aspose.Words.87635768-8353-44da-803f-eb663e40a244.010.png)

P1=P2⇒F1A1=F2A2





1. Archimedes’ Principle

says that every body fully immersed or partially in any liquid is subjected to a vertical force (called **buoyant force**) from bottom to top, equal to the weight of the portion of the liquid displaced by the body and applied to the point where it was located the center of mass of this portion of fluid

bigger fluid ρ → bigger buoyant force

**Carena Center (C)** is the center of gravity of the submerged part of the body and is the point of application of thrust

**Metacenter (M)** point around which the kiel center rotates

**Metacentric Height (MH)** is the distance between M and CG (center of gravity) - MH = M-CG

1. ## <a name="_vcp8vvrg6jaz"></a>Hydrodynamics
studies the effect of forces on fluid motion

when analyzing the movement of fluids, it’s necessary to observe their characteristic of pressure, velocity, temperature and density

and also the container theys store them, such as area, height and shape

1. Continuity Equation

say that, although any pipe doesn’t have the same cross-sectional area along its length, the flow rate (discharge mass) along its entire length is the same.

That is, the points where the cross-sectional area is smaller, the velocity will be bigger. This increase is due to the pressure velocity, which is generated by the pressure difference between the bigger and smaller area.

⇒ S1\*v1=S2\*v2  ⇒ D1=D2  and  Q1=Q2










1. Bernoulli’s Principle

Establishes that the energy, in a steady flow, is constant along the path described by the fluid and can be deduced from the kinetic energy theorem.

*“The work of the resultant of the forces acting on a body between two instants is equal to the change in kinetic energy experienced by the body in that time interval.”*

` `F1→\*τ	   F2→\*τ  	         W\*τ

First ‘-’ is because F1 and Dm has opposite directions

Second ‘-’ is because F2 and Dm has opposite directions

from  S1\*Δx1=S2\*Δx2  and  the Kinetic Energy Theorem:

τnet=(P1-P2)\*mρ-m\*g\*(h2-h1)  and  τnet=ΔEk   

so:  (P1-P2)\*mρ-m\*g\*(h2-h1)=m\*v222-m\*v122

P1+ρ\*v122+ρ\*g\*h1=P2+ρ\*v222+ρ\*g\*h2

simplifying:

P+ρ\*v22+ρ\*g\*h=cst

,  where  P and ρ\*g\*h is the Static Pressure

`         `ρ\*v22 is the Dynamic Pressure

1. ## <a name="_7tvlwvcw89yu"></a>Thermodynamics
studies the relationships between heat, work, temperature and other quantities, such as pressure, volume, etc.

it is responsible for the establishment of laws that govern all the transformations that can be suffered by matter.

1. ### <a name="_lmnaajf3n8lx"></a>Laws of Thermodynamics

**Law zero**: it is the law of thermal equilibrium. 

This law says that all bodies tend to exchange heat until they reach thermal equilibrium.

**First law**: it is the law of conservation of energy. 

This law states that all the heat (Q) received by a system during a thermodynamic process can be converted into work (τ) or an increase in its internal energy (ΔU). 

**Q = τ + ΔU**

\1) regarding heat (Q):

Q > 0, the system receives heat.

Q < 0, the system loses heat.

C = 0, the system does not receive or give heat.

\2) regarding work (τ):

τ > 0, the volume is expanded.

τ < 0, the volume is reduced.

τ = 0, the volume is constant.

\3) regarding the variation of internal energy (ΔU):

ΔU > 0, there is an increase in temperature.

ΔU < 0, there is a decrease in temperature.

ΔU =0, the temperature is constant.

**Second law:** it is the law of entropy (S).

*“Heat cannot flow spontaneously from a lower temperature body to a higher temperature body.”* - Clausius

*“It is impossible to build a machine which, operating in a thermodynamic cycle, converts the entire amount of heat received into work.”* - Kelvin-Planck

Entropy (S) is the degree of disorder or uncertainty in a system. So, if an amount of heat Q flows into a heat reservoir at constant temperature T, so its entropy S increases by 

**ΔS = Q/T**

Entropy never decreases, remaining constant for reversible processes, or increasing for irreversible processes.

Let's say that there are two heat reservoirs R1 and R2 at temperatures T1 and T2. If an amount of heat Q flows from R1 to R2, then the net entropy change for the two reservoirs is:

**ΔS = Q/T2 - Q/T1**


**Heat Engine**

System capable of doing work in a cyclic fashion.

Absorbs heat Q1 from R1 and exhausts heat Q2 to R2 for each complete cycle. 

Then, by conservation of energy, the work done per cycle is             W = τ = Q1 − Q2, and the net entropy change for the two reservoirs is       ΔS = Q/T2 - Q/T1.

*Max efficiency of the engine*

**nmax = 1 - (Q2/Q1)min = 1 - (T2/T1)**

**n = τ/Q1**
































![](Aspose.Words.87635768-8353-44da-803f-eb663e40a244.018.png)




**Third law:** it is the law of absolute zero. 

*“The entropy of the system tends to zero if its temperature approaches zero.”* - Nernst  

This law tells us that at 0K, the internal energy of the body is zero, without molecular motion. If Q = τ - 100% yield, no loss. Absolute zero has never been reached in the laboratory.

**Q = ΔU + τ** 


1. # <a name="_ddr0m4v28zjq"></a>**Waveform**
A wave is an oscillation that travels through space.

Wave motion transfers energy from one point to another, with little or no associated mass transport.

Consists of oscillations or vibrations around almost fixed locations.

Is confined in some finite region of space, called its **domain.**

1. ## <a name="_bzm2j2jhcyzj"></a>Types of waves
**Mechanical waves:** require a medium to propagate, local deformation in some medium that propagates from particle to particle by creating local stresses that cause strain in neighboring particles too. *- sound waves*

**Electromagnetic waves:** do not require a medium to propagate, instead, they consist of periodic oscillations in electrical and magnetic fields generated by charged particles. Can travel through a vacuum. *- light*

**Gravitational Waves** disturbances in spacetime, **Heat diffusion, plasma waves** combina mechanical deformations and electromagnetics fields, **reaction-diffusion waves.**

**OBS:** Electromagnetic and Mechanical Waves transfer energy, momentum and information - not particles.







1. ## <a name="_1vb2ntda07r4"></a>Concepts
The distance between successive **crests** or **troughs** is called wavelength. 

The height of a wave is the **amplitude**. 

How many crests or troughs pass a specific point during a unit of time is called the **frequency**. 

The **velocity** of a wave can be expressed as the wavelength multiplied by the frequency.

**Transverse:** the field disturbance at each point is described by a vector perpendicular to the direction of propagation, also the direction of energy transfer *- radiation*

**Longitudinal:** the field disturbance at each point is described by a vector is exactly to the direction of propagation *- sound*

In **diffraction**, waves bend when they pass around small obstacles (compared with the wavelength) and spread out when they pass through small openings. 

In **interference**, when two waves meet, they can interfere **constructively**, creating a wave with larger amplitude than the original waves, or **destructively**, creating a wave with a smaller (or even zero) amplitude.

1. ## <a name="_5dmlywt9xj64"></a>Geometrical optics
Has to do with the principles that govern the image-forming properties of lenses, mirrors, and other devices that make use of light.

It is sometimes more convenient to regard an image as being composed of overlapping patterns of varying frequencies and contrasts.

An **optical image** is a reproduction of an object by a lens or mirror system, employing light as a carrier. 

An **entire image** is generally produced simultaneously, as by the lens in a camera, but images may also be generated sequentially by point-by-point scanning, as in a television system.

A **real image** is formed outside the system, where the emerging rays actually cross (can be caught on a screen or piece of film).

A **virtual image** is formed inside an instrument at the point where diverging rays would cross if they were extended backward into the instrument (can be caught in a microscope or telescope - see looking into the eyepiece).

A **paraxial ray** is a ray that makes a small angle with the optical axis of the system throughout its entire path. At any point in the optical system, we will have a small angle of the ray in relation to the optical axis.

Use of polished mirrors for reflecting light 

*Concave mirrors* forms a real image of distant objects (telescopes)

*Convex mirrors* forms a virtual image of distant objects

*Plane mirrors* forms a virtual image of near objects

The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence - angle between the normal and the ray.

1. ### <a name="_xya1xtfl1at1"></a>Refraction
Ray of light is sharply bent or refracted when passing one medium to another.

Based on the fact that light travels slowly in denser medium.

The ratio between the velocity of light in air to its velocity in the medium is called **refractive index** (n) of the medium for light of a particular color or wavelength.

In the light spectrum, closer to blue, higher n, closer to red, lower n.

![](Aspose.Words.87635768-8353-44da-803f-eb663e40a244.026.png)

n'n = AB/BA'A'B'/BA' = sin Isin I'  ⇒  n'\*sin I' = n\*sin I

I is angle of incidence and I' is angle of refraction

When the incident angle is equal to the **critical angle** (in water-air surface is 48.5º), the reflected angle will be 90º, if it’s greater than the critical one, it will be a total internal reflection.

**Spherical mirrors**

A spherical cap with a polished surface. 

They can be concave or convex: 

*in concave* the reflective face is the inner one, 

*in convex* the reflective face is the outer one.

**Radius of curvature (R):** consists of the radius of the spherical surface that originated the cap, that is, the mirror itself.

**Center of curvature (C):** is the center of the original sphere.

**Vertex (V):** is the hub of the cap.

**Main Focus (F):** point to which rays parallel to the main axis are reflected

**Focal length (f):** is the distance from the vertex to the main focus and is approximately half the radius of curvature.

**Principal Axis:** he line passing through the center of curvature and the vertex.

**Secondary axes:** are lines perpendicular to the mirror surface that pass through the center of curvature.

1. # <a name="_2jpiunrazv1f"></a>**Electricity & Magnetism**
**Electricity** is the *flow of electric charge*, that is, the result of the accumulation or motion of numbers of particles *- like electrons and ions*. Is also referred to as an **energy carrier**, it can be converted to other forms *- such as mechanical energy or heat*. 

**Magnetism**,** caused by the *motion of electric charges,* is the *force exerted by magnets* when they *attract or repel* each other.

1. ## <a name="_xq1mq487zal1"></a>Electricity
The one we use is a *secondary energy source* because it is produced by converting primary sources of energy *- such as coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, solar energy, and wind energy -* into electrical power. 

Primary energy sources are **renewable** *- can replenish itself at the rate it is used -* or **nonrenewable** energy *- has a limited supply*.

The outermost electrons of an atom are called the **valence electrons**, these require the least amount of force to be freed from an atom. Using enough *electrostatic force* on the valence electron, we can eject the electron from orbit around the atom creating a free electron.

As our **free electrons** are floating in a space between atoms. In this chaos the free electron eventually finds a new atom to latch on to; in doing so, the negative charge of that electron ejects another valence electron from the atom. Now a new electron is drifting through free space looking to do the same thing. This chain effect can continue on and on to create a flow of electrons called electric current.

**Current electricity** exists when charges *- usually an electron  -* are able to constantly flow, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes *(A)*.

To do that, a *circuit* is required, which is a closed, never-ending loop of conductive material - a mix of wires and other components to control the flow.

Can't have any *insulating gaps*.

**Direct current** *(DC)*** is a one-directional flow of electric charge. **Alternating current** *(AC)*** will, periodically, reverse the direction and change its magnitude continuously with time.

An element's **conductivity** measures how tightly bound an electron is to an atom, with *high conductivity* are called **conductors** *- good to create an electron flow, such as metals (copper, silver, and gold)*. Elements with *low conductivity* are called **insulators** *- good to prevent the flow of electrons, such as glass, rubber, plastic, and air.*

**Charge** *(Q)* is a property of matter *- such as mass, vol -* that can be *positive (+)* or *negative (-)* and is determined by the electrons *negative*, prótons *positive* e neutrons *neutral*. Electrons carries approximately -1.6022\*10-19 Coulombs and protons carries +1.6022\*10-19 C.

**Electric Power** is the rate at electrical energy is transferred by an electric circuit P=QVΔt.


**Electric fields** describe the *pulling* or *pushing* *force* in a space between charges. Its *direction* is always defined as the direction a positive ‘test charge’ *- is infinitely small -* would move if it was dropped in the field.

It’s magnitude is calculated by: E=kQd²=Fq N.

For a **single negative charge** we draw our electric field arrows *pointing* *inward* at all directions. For a **single positive charge** we draw arrows *going out* of the positive charge.

A **uniform field** points from positive to negative charges. The *flow of electrons* flows in **directions opposite** to the** electric fields.


1. ## <a name="_wpsnw0xjnjjr"></a>Magnetism
Substances are made of atoms. Inside them, the electrons circle *- spinning -* the nucleus, which generates an electric current and causes each electron to act like a magnet. 

If equal numbers of electrons spin in opposite directions will cancel their magnetism, if the most spin in the same direction make the atom strongly magnetic. The *spin direction* will determine the magnetic field direction.

**Magnetic field**, a vector field in the neighborhood of a magnet, electric current or changing electric fields, in which magnetic forces are observable. Its source are dipoles, meaning that they have a **N**orth and **S**outh pole - **N**&**S** *attract* and **N**&**N** or **S**&**S** *repel*. 

So, the direction of the field propagates outward from the north pole and enters through the south pole. Its lines never cross each other and always make closed loops. The density of the lines indicates the strength of the field.

The strength is a vector **H** and is defined as H=Bμ-M, where **B** is the magnetic flux density - *measure the magnetic force acting per unit current per unit length*; **μ** is the magnetic permeability *- measure a material's resistance to the magnetic field or the degree to which magnetic field can penetrate through a material*; **M** is the magnetization *- measures the density of permanent or induced dipole moment in a given magnetic material*. In vacuum, there is no magnetization. Is measured in tesla **T**, which is defined in terms of how much force is applied to moving a charge due to the field.

![](Aspose.Words.87635768-8353-44da-803f-eb663e40a244.052.png)

**Magnetic Flux** refers to the amount of magnetic field lines that cross an area - measure in Webers *(Wb --- 1 Wb=1 T/m²)*. It relates the strength of the magnetic field to the area and the angle between the magnetic field lines and the normal line of the area.

Φ=B\*A\*cosθ, where θ is the angle between B and the normal of area A  &&  B the magnetic field


The movement of molten metal in the Earth’s outer core generates electric currents, which creates a magnetic field in Earth. The geomagnetic poles often move, due to activity far beneath the Earth’s surface. 

The shifting locations of the geomagnetic poles are recorded in rocks that form when molten material - magma - wells up through the Earth’s crust and pours out as lava. As lava cools and becomes solid rock, strongly magnetic particles within the rock become magnetized by the Earth’s magnetic field. The particles line up along the lines of force in the Earth’s field. In this way, rocks lock in a record of the position of the Earth’s geomagnetic poles at that time.

Electrical Elements

A voltage source is a two-terminal device which can maintain a fixed voltage. An ideal voltage source can maintain the fixed voltage independent of the load resistance or the output current. However, a real-world voltage source cannot supply unlimited current.

A current source is an electronic circuit that delivers or absorbs an electric current which is independent of the voltage across it.

**Inductance** is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the electric current flowing through it.

**Capacitance** is the ratio of the amount of electric charge stored on a conductor to a difference in electric potential. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: *self capacitance* and *mutual capacitance*.


1. ## <a name="_2ky1t1baml1n"></a>Electrostatics
Deals with the phenomena and properties of stationary or slow-moving electric charges. These phenomena arise from the forces that electric charges exert on each other and are described by Coulomb’s Law.

**Static electricity** exists when there is a build-up of opposite charges on objects separated by an insulator. Will exists until the opposite charges find a path between each other to balance the system out, which creates a static discharge - like lightning. The force is measured using Coulomb's Law.

**Coulomb's Law** calculates the *magnitude* of the *electrostatic force* that operates between charges. *Opposites* charges *attract* each other, and *like* charges *repel* each other. The *amount of force* depends on how far they are from each other, the closer two charges get, the greater the force *- either pushing together, or pulling away -* becomes.

1. ## <a name="_xtg4allwpdum"></a>Electromagnetism
Deals with the electromagnetic force that occurs between electrically charged particles. It is based on the **Faraday Law**: *moving electric charges generate a magnetic field* and *changing magnetic flux produces an electric field*.

Following Faraday Law, when there is a variation/change of magnetic field flux in some conductive circuit, as in a coil, an induced **electromotive force** *(electrical voltage)* arises in that conductor. 

Uses negative when considering that the electric current that is induced always arises in order to oppose the variation of external magnetic flux.

ϵ=ΔΦΔt *Volts*

**Electromagnetic fields** are concentrations of electric and magnetic charges, which move like waves - they are called electromagnetic waves - light is one, propagate at the speed of light and are transverse waves. 

f=vλ, where f is frequency, and λ is wavelength

The **electromagnetic force** is a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles and is the combination of all magnetic and electrical forces *- can be attractive or repulsive*. Also called Lorentz force: F=qE+qv×B.

1. ## <a name="_i3i94441yq5v"></a>Electrochemistry
Concerned with the relationship between electrical potential difference, as a measurable and quantitative phenomenon, and identifiable chemical change, with the potential difference as an outcome of a particular chemical change, or vice versa.

When a chemical reaction is driven by an electrical potential difference, as in electrolysis, or if a potential difference results from a chemical reaction as in a battery or fuel cell, it is called an electrochemical reaction. 

Unlike in other chemical reactions, in electrochemical reactions electrons are not transferred directly between atoms, ions, or molecules, but via the aforementioned electronically-conducting circuit. This phenomenon is what distinguishes an electrochemical reaction from a conventional chemical reaction.

They define a relationship between **space** and **time**, both being relative and not static. That is, *time* changes depending on the observer, according to three variables: *speed*, *gravity* and *space*.

1. ## <a name="_58f72g40zpd5"></a>Galilean Transformation
Is used to transform between the coordinates of two reference frames which differ only by constant relative motion within the constructs of Newtonian physics. 

The equations below are only physically valid in a Newtonian framework, and not applicable to coordinate systems moving relative to each other at speeds approaching the speed of light.

Formally express the ideas that space and time are absolute; that length, time, and mass are independent of the relative motion of the observer; and that the speed of light depends upon the relative motion of the observer *- wrong*.

The transformations embody the intuitive notion of addition and subtraction of velocities as vectors.

The notation below describes the relationship under the transformation between the coordinates (x, y, z, t) and (x′, y′, z′, t′) of a single arbitrary event, measured in two coordinate systems S and S′, in uniform relative motion (velocity v) in their common x and x′ directions, with their spatial origins coinciding at time t = t′ = 0:

*x' = x - v\*t    ||    y' = y    ||    z' = z    ||    t' = t*

*Vertical line is the Time   ---   Horizontal line is the X Space   ---   only X change*

This transformation was not compatible with electromagnetism and does not keep the speed of light constant, although it explains everyday experiences very well.








1. ## <a name="_vvws30wsn84y"></a>Lorentz Transformation
They describe how, according to special relativity, the measurements of space and time of two observers change in each frame of reference.

They reflect the fact that observers moving at different speeds measure different values of distance, time and, in some cases, the ordering of events.

For very small velocities (v << c), the Galileo transformations can be used as an excellent approximation *- gamma value is close to 1*.

Formally express the relativity ideas that space and time are not absolute; that length, time, and mass depend on the relative motion of the observer; and that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant and independent of the motion of the observer or the source.

If we want a transformation that keeps the speed of light constant for ALL frames of reference, both space and time cannot remain constant for frame changes.

The notation below describes the relationship under the transformation between the coordinates (x, y, z, t) and (x′, y′, z′, t′) of a single arbitrary event, measured in two coordinate systems S and S′, in uniform relative motion (velocity v) in their common x and x′ directions, with their spatial origins coinciding at time t = t′ = 0:

*x' =* γ*( x - v\*t )    ||    y' = y    ||    z' = z    ||    t' =* γ*( t - vxc²)  --*  γ=1/1-vc²

*Detail: if the speed v = c, it would reach an indeterminacy 1/0, so, it is impossible for the event to travel at the speed of light.*

1. ## <a name="_32clya14s4i7"></a>Special Relativity
Generalizes *Electromagnetism* and *Newtonian Physics* into one theory.

Stick only to systems in which **gravitational fields** are **not** taken into account.

It states that **space** and **time** are **subjective quantities,** *a unified geometric entity - 4D*, for when there is velocity close to the light.

Time and space are no longer invariant when changing the reference system, becoming dependent on the *observer's state of movement* *- simultaneity is relative*.

**Ex:** two events that occur simultaneously in different places of the same reference system can occur at different times in another reference system *- observer*.

The **temporal intervals** between events depend on the reference system in which they are measured *- paradox of the twins*. The distances between occurrences as well.

Defines the absence of an **absolute reference system.**

The name **Tachion** was used to name hypothetical particles that would always move at a speed higher than light *- there is no experimental evidence of its existence*.

Relationship between mass and energy:

E=mc²*, where E is energy, m is mass and c is speed of light*

If the body is moving at speed v relative to the observer, the energy of the body is:

E=γmc², where γ=11-vc²

*if* v≪c:

E=γmc²≈mc²+mv²2

Postulates:

**1st:** the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference systems.

**2nd:** the speed of light in vacuum *(300,000 km/s)* is the same in all inertial frames of reference.

1. ## <a name="_pujtr4yzzmtd"></a>General Relativity
*“spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve” --* John A. Wheeler

Is a set of hypotheses that generalizes *Special Relativity* and *Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation*, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or *spacetime*.

The theory is based on the **Equivalence Principle**, which indicates that, through an experiment carried out locally, it is not possible to say whether the acceleration suffered by a body is due to *gravity* or the application of an *external* *force* of a nature other than gravitational, since their effects will be similar. 

**Ex:** drop a ball on a spaceship with acceleration of g m/s, it falls because of the gravitational field or its inertia.

One of its consequences is that, if a region of space is accelerated by the application of a force, if there is a gravitational field at that location that cancels this acceleration, the observer will not be able to discern whether or not it is an inertial frame of reference.

Large masses are capable of **distorting space** and **time** *- the greater the mass, the greater the curvature*, this distortion is what we call *gravity*. When the velocity of the mass is high, *gravitational waves* are created.

**Gravity well** is the potential field around a massive body *- the more massive the body, the larger and deeper the well*.

**Gravitational frequency** is when light is sent into the gravitational well it is blueshifted OR when light is leaving the gravitational well it is redshifted.

Processes close to a massive body are slower when compared to processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as **gravitational time dilation**.

The lower the **gravitational potential** *- the closer the clock is from the gravitation source*, the slower time passes, accelerating as the gravitational potential increases *- the clock distances itself from the gravitation source*.

So, the more intense the field, the slower time would pass.

Since light propagates through space, which is curved, it will take different times for observers who are in regions with different gravitational accelerations.

**Ex:** The deflection of light by gravity *- it’s path is crooked -* can lead to the phenomenon of *gravitational lens - causing repeating stars or blurry images*.
