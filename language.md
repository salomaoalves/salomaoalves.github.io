# Programming Languages
Programming languages that I like and gather some knowledege about it. 
[Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages)

*Some files will have more information, other less; this will depend on how much information I find when I was studying, or what was the reason of the study.*\
*Remember, this is a work in progress, so some things are still in development and the goal is to never finish, always add and gather more knowledge.*

First, in the root, you can see two `.md` files, which contain information about **GoLang** and **Octave**. In both, I didn't gather to much knowledege about it, more the basic and first steps. The reason is that I find them interesting but not the main ones used in the data field, so I didn't want expand too much time on them *unfortunately time is finite*. So I dicide to just take some look, gather some information, and, maybe, in the future, add more knowledge to them.

The other file in the root is about the **Mojo** language *file `test.mojo`*. This is a new language, recently open-source, so there isn't too much about it, the *gather information process* is still in its early stages.

The folders has more information about the language, see below for more details.

## Julia
 > Is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language, most commonly used for numerical analysis and computational science.

A fast compiled language like C but with a wide array of programming skills from languages like Lisp, Python, Ruby, R and Matlab.\
Use LLVM low-level virtual machines, to compile the program right down to the machine code level.

Inside, can find a folder `data` where the data, used by the jupyter notebooks, is stored. The `.ipynb` files this notebooks with the language knowledege - see below for more.

**AI_ML**\
Here you can find how to perform some Artificial Inteligency and/or Machine Learning algorithms and methods, like Dimensionality Reduction, Label Encoder, AUC and Confusion Matrix, Clustering, Classification and Regression.

**Base**\
Here is the language basic, things like Operators, how to install and use package, the Data Types, Data Structures, Loops, Functions, Constructor and Macro. With this, you already can build some application, resolve computer problems and start learning the language. Here it'll be the ground zero for beginners.

**Dataframe**\
Here has a bunch of functions, methods and tricks to deal with data in a Dataframe format. You can find how too read one *in more than one way*, make filters, selects rows, joins, rename cols/rows, data details, transform and group by methods, sort, missing values and so on.\
Basically, things useful when you want to perform some operation over de data, e.g., when you are doing some data processing or cleaning.

**LoadData**\
Data can be in various formats, here you can find how to read and write data in this many ways.\
Some of the formats are: Arrow, Txt, Delimited, CSV, XLSX, JLD, NPZ, RDA and MAT.

**Math**\
Here is more math functions and methods, like Statistics *distributions* and Linear Algebra.

**Visualization**\
Plot data is always important, here you can find more of how to do it.


## Python

Inside, can find a folder `data` where the data used in the files *with code explanation* is stored. 

## R
First, you see two `.pdf` files, both are *Cheat Sheet*, very usefull when are dealing with *Dplyr* or *GGPlot2* packages. And than, three `.md` files with language knowledege.

**R**\
The basic, the ground zero for beginners in R. Here can be found more about how to use markdown within R, build-in functions, data types, operators, OOP, structures, packages *dplyr, tidyr, ..* and how to plot data

**RDataScience**\
Functions and methods related with some steps during a Data Science project. You can find ways to clean the data, make data correlation, feature selection, data split and machine learning *- data in a dataframe format*.

**RStatistics**\
Stats functions and methos stay here. Functions to deal with qualitative and quantitative data, correlation, combinatorial and sampling functions, distributions examples and usability, statistics tests and multivariate analysis methods.
