> A quick overview over the projects - its divided into repos/fields of Data Science


# Data Science - Analysis and Explore
[Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_Analysis-Explore) that show techniques of how see throw data, how to explore and understanding it. Above a list of each project explanation:
  - [Brazil Governament Spend](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2020/12/29/explore/analysis): in this project, I clean, transform and explore the Brazil governamental spending during 2016.
  - [Company Financial Health](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2020/12/29/explore/analysis): here I explore and analysis a company financial data, calculate some metrics and look closer to some columns. *Proposed by Data Science Academy*
  - [Company Sales](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2020/12/29/explore/analysis): here I answer 10 question about sales data from a company.
  - [Human Resources](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2020/12/29/explore/analysis): explore data related with HR, using Python and R. *Proposed by Data Science Academy*
  - [Airbnb](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2024/05/12/Airbnb/): a project to test Julia language techniques for data explore. *IN DEVELOPMENT*

# Data Science - Machine Learning
[Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_MachineLearning) where I develop machine learning and inteligence artificial algorithms. Above a list of each project explanation:
  - [Customer Churn](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2020/12/30/machine/learning): I created a logistic regression model, using Python, to predict whether or not a customer would cancel their cell phone plan - along with the percentage of each possibility. Also, some cleaning, exploration and data preparation was done, along with feature selection (kBest). *Proposed by Data Science Academy*
  - [Customer Satisfaction](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2020/12/30/machine/learning): algorithm to predict customer satisfaction with a banking institution. Also, some cleaning, exploration and data preparation was done, along with feature selection (Correlation) and machine learning (Logistic Reg, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SBC and SGBC Class). *Proposed by Data Science Academy*
  - [Energy](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2020/12/30/machine/learning): algorithm to predict household energy usage. Also, some cleaning, exploration and data preparation was done, along with feature selection (Decision Tree) and machine learning (Linear Reg, Lasso, Random Forest and XGB Reg). *Proposed by Data Science Academy*
  - [Fraud Detection](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2020/12/30/machine/learning): using R and data about clicks (in ads), I did some data cleaning, feature selection (Random Forest) and machine learning algorithms (SVM and Random Forest) to predict click fraud in companies advertising online. *Proposed by Data Science Academy*
  - [Insta & Youtube Comments](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2022/10/19/nlp/comments): a web application, that from a given text  - can be from a uploaded file, default text or the comments of a YouTube video or Instagram post (pass the post/video url) - apply some NLP methods into the data.
  - [Airbnb](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2024/05/12/Airbnb/): a project to test Julia language techniques for NLP. *IN DEVELOPMENT*

# Data Science - Visualization
[Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_Visualization) with projects that show how data can be displayed, telling its story/information through images and graphics. Above a list of each project explanation:
  - [Google Calender](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2023/11/12/GCalender/): if you don't know what happens in your life, this project track your google calender events and show it in a dashboard or a text report. The only thing you need to do is keep a pattern and honesty when creating events.
  - [Airbnb](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2024/05/12/Airbnb/): a project to test Julia language techniques for data visualization. *IN DEVELOPMENT*

# Data Science - Others
[Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_Others) for projects from other data science fields, like Recommende System, Marketing Analytics and so on. Above a list of each project explanation:
  - [Marketing Analytics](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2020/12/28/fields): has some projects related with the business area of marketing. Techniques and methods that help to improve performace in this area. *ABTest, CustomerSegmentation and OptimizationProblems was proposed by Data Science Academy*
  - [Music List](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_Others/tree/main/MscList): this was a start of a Spotify project, but I didn't like the lib usability and I had others stuffs on hand, so I pause this project and I leave a bunch of function; of how to connect, get top artist and so on.
  - [Recommend System](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2020/12/28/fields): has some algorithms of recommend systems, to suggest the best option the user will want - some times a I suggestion that he didn't even know he wanted.
  - [Wikipedia Link](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2023/06/01/wikipedia/link): I want to test Neo4J database, so I find a graph project, basically, if you click in the first hyperlink (has some rules that should be followed) of a Wikipedia page, and continuous doing that, you will, probably, ending in the Philosophy page or in a loop. I use Neo4J to store and query this data.
