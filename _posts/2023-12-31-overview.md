> A quick overview over the projects - its divided into repos/fields of Data Science


# Data Science - Analysis and Explore
[Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_Analysis-Explore) that show techniques of how see throw data, how to explore and understanding it. Above a list of each project explanation:
  - [Brazil Governament Spend](https://salomaoalves.github.io/): in this project, I clean, transform and explore the Brazil governamental spending during 2016.
  - [Company Financial Health](https://salomaoalves.github.io/): here I explore and analysis a company financial data, calculate some metrics and look closer to some columns.
  - [Company Sales](https://salomaoalves.github.io/): here I answer 10 question about sales data from a company.
  - [Human Resources](https://salomaoalves.github.io/)
  - [Wash Hands](https://salomaoalves.github.io/)
  - [Airbnb](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2024/01/12/Airbnb/): a project to test Julia language techniques for data explore. *IN DEVELOPMENT*

# Data Science - Machine Learning
[Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_MachineLearning) where I develop machine learning and inteligence artificial algorithms. Above a list of each project explanation:
  - [Customer Churn](https://salomaoalves.github.io/)
  - [Customer Satisfaction](https://salomaoalves.github.io/)
  - [Energy](https://salomaoalves.github.io/)
  - [Fraud Detection](https://salomaoalves.github.io/)
  - [Insta & Youtube Comments](https://salomaoalves.github.io/) (maybe move to Others, because has NLP like Wiki1Link)

# Data Science - Visualization
[Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_Visualization) with projects that show how data can be displayed, telling its story/information through images and graphics. Above a list of each project explanation:
  - [Google Calender](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2023/11/12/GCalender/): if you don't know what happens in your life, this project track your google calender events and show it in a dashboard or a text report. The only thing you need to do is keep a pattern and honesty when creating events.
  - [Airbnb](https://salomaoalves.github.io/2024/01/12/Airbnb/): a project to test Julia language techniques for data visualization. *IN DEVELOPMENT*

# Data Science - Others
[Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_Others) for projects from other data science fields, like Recommende System, Marketing Analytics and so on. Above a list of each project explanation:
  - [Marketing Analytics](https://salomaoalves.github.io/): has some projects related with the business area of marketing. Techniques and methods that help to improve performace in this area.
  - [Music List](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_Others/tree/main/MscList): this was a start of a Spotify project, but I didn't like the lib usability and I had others stuffs on hand, so I pause this project. So I leave just a bunch of function; of how to connect, get top artist and so on.
  - [Recommend System](https://salomaoalves.github.io/): has some algorithms of recommend systems, to suggest the best option the user will want - some times a I suggestion that he didn't even know he wanted.
  - [Wikipedia Link](https://salomaoalves.github.io/): I want to test Neo4J database, so I find a graph project, basically, if you click in the first hyperlink (has some rules that should be followed) of a Wikipedia page, and continuous doing that, you will, probably, ending in the Philosophy page or in a loop. I use Neo4J to store and query this data.
