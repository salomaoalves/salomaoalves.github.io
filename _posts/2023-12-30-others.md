In my programming life, I develop a bunch of code, here, I would like to describe some extra repos that I have in my GitHub and is not directly related to Data Science.

The repos are: 
  - [College-Assignment](https://github.com/salomaoalves/College-Assignment): this has all assignment I did, sometimes in group with some colleagues, during College.
  - [Machine Learning](https://github.com/salomaoalves/MachineLearning): a example of Linear and Logist Regression algorithm using Octave.
  - [Python Things](https://github.com/salomaoalves/PythonThings): here has a bunch of python code. Some exercicies, random programs and some code related of some python libs.
  - [Tableau Dashboards](https://github.com/salomaoalves/TableauDashboards): here has some Tableaus files, has some examples of dashboards. They're a little old, I did for a course that I take in Udemy portal - it was for learning reasons.
  - [Tensor Flow](https://github.com/salomaoalves/TensorFlow): a Simple Linear Regression using the python lib Tensor Flow - just a code example.
