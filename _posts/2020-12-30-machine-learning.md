> Here has some projects about machine learning algorithm; they're all a script, following a pattern. So a list of tecquines used will be show and a short description of each project.

# Data Science - Machine Learning
[Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_MachineLearning) where I develop machine learning and inteligence artificial algorithms. Above a list of each project explanation:
  - [Customer Churn](https://salomaoalves.github.io/): I created a logistic regression model, using Python, to predict whether or not a customer would cancel their cell phone plan - along with the percentage of each possibility. Also, some cleaning, exploration and data preparation was done, along with feature selection (kBest). *Proposed by Data Science Academy*
  - [Customer Satisfaction](https://salomaoalves.github.io/): algorithm to predict customer satisfaction with a banking institution. Also, some cleaning, exploration and data preparation was done, along with feature selection (Correlation) and machine learning (Logistic Reg, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SBC and SGBC Class). *Proposed by Data Science Academy*
  - [Energy](https://salomaoalves.github.io/): algorithm to predict household energy usage. Also, some cleaning, exploration and data preparation was done, along with feature selection (Decision Tree) and machine learning (Linear Reg, Lasso, Random Forest and XGB Reg). *Proposed by Data Science Academy*
  - [Fraud Detection](https://salomaoalves.github.io/): using R and data about clicks (in ads), I did some data cleaning, feature selection (Random Forest) and machine learning algorithms (SVM and Random Forest) to predict click fraud in companies advertising online. *Proposed by Data Science Academy*
