> A Report and Dashboard of your life, at least how much you are willing to track in Google Calender.

Click here to see the [Github Repo](https://github.com/salomaoalves/DataScience_Visualization/tree/main/GCalendar) with more technical information *has a readme*.


This project ~~which can me divide in two parts~~ has the goal to show ~~in two differents ways~~ the events from a **Google Calender** account. 

The Google Calender events need to follow a pattern in realted to its colors. Since I was building it to use with my personal account, two patterns was created, or almost two. Look, for date older than 2022 ~~from 2018 to 2021, exactly~~ a random report was made, you can see more about in `Report|2018-21` and `report_specifYear.py` - this was the "first" part. The other part use the others files and folders, and the events are from 2022 onwards.

In short, the code usefull for you to use in your personal Google Calender is every file and folder, except `Report|2018-21` and `report_specifYear.py` *and one more*. IMPORTANT remember to see the colors patterns for the events, they are extremely important.

You can visualize you events in two ways, with a **Report** or a **Dashboard**.
