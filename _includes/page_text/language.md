Programming languages that I like and gather some knowledege about it. 
[Github Repo link](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages)

*The folders has more detailed information about a certain language than the files.*\
*Some files will have more information, other less; varies depending on the objective of the study.*\
*Remember, this is a work in progress, so some things are still in development and the goal is to never finish, always add and gather more knowledge.*

First, in the root, you can see two `.md` files, which contain information about [**GoLang**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/GoLang.md) and [**Octave**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Octave.md). In both, I didn't gather to much knowledege about it, more the basic and first steps. The reason is that I find them interesting but not the main ones used in the data field, so I didn't want expend too much time on them *unfortunately time is finite*. So I decided to just take some look, gather some information, and, maybe, in the future, add more knowledge to them.

The other file in the root is about the **Mojo** language *file `test.mojo`*. This is a new language, so there isn't too much about it, the *gather information process* is still in its early stages.

There are two other folders, called `img`, which contains images that will be used in some file. And the `Human` folder, which contain markdown files for languages that human speak; for now, there is a [**English**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Human/english.md) and [**EspaÃ±ol**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Human/espanol.md) file - they contain explanation of grammar, tricks words and more.

## [Julia](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/tree/main/Julia)
 > Is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language, most commonly used for numerical analysis and computational science

A fast compiled language like C but with a wide array of programming skills from languages like Lisp, Python, Ruby, R and Matlab. Use LLVM low-level virtual machines, to compile the program right down to the machine code level.

Inside, can find a folder `data` where the data, used by the jupyter notebooks, is stored. The `.ipynb` files has the language knowledege.

Basically, things useful when you want to perform some operation over de data, e.g., when you are doing some data processing or cleaning.

[**LoadData.ipynb**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Julia/LoadData.ipynb)\
Data can be in various formats, here you can find how to read and write data in this many ways.\

Plot data is always important, here you can find more of how to do it.


## [Python](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/tree/main/Python)
 > Is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Dynamically typed, interpreter and garbage-collected and supports multiple programming paradigms, like procedural, object-oriented and functional programing.

Inside, can find a folder `data` where the data used in the files *with code explanation* is stored. The `.ipynb` files has the language knowledege.

[**Base.ipynb**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Python/Base.ipynb)\
It's the language basic, the ground zero for beginners. Here you can find information about how to create variables, operators, data types, data colletions *list, dicts, set*, control structures *IFs, Loops, Error Handling*, function definitions, object-oriented programming and how open and edit files.

[**CustomFunc.ipynb**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Python/CustomFunc.ipynb)\
Python functions that I did myself and can be usefull in future projects, like to send a Email or a SMS.

[**Database.ipynb**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Python/Database.ipynb)\
If you wanna work with data, you need to deal with database. Here, with have some code of how to use the following database services: SQLite -- MySQL -- PostgreSQL -- AWS RDS -- BigQuery -- MongoDB -- Neo4J.\
Generally, you'll find how to connect with the db, make sql queries and others things.

[**DataScienceCode.ipynb**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Python/DataScienceCode.ipynb)\
Here, has some piece of code that can be usefull when is doing a data science project, like to preprocess the data - remove outliers/missing values or label encoder the data, or functions to help explore the data - see its distributions, pivot table, resume data information.\
Also, in *Free Code*, you'll find piece of code that is usefull when is dealing with data, like dates, filter and so on.

[**libsPython.ipynb**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Python/libsPython.ipynb)\

[**Others.ipynb**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Python/Others.ipynb)\
Knowledege about others topics, but in early stages. Here has many topics, or none, if a topic gets big, is better to create its own jupyter file.

[**Statistics.ipynb**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/Python/Statistics.ipynb)\
Stats functions and methos stay here. Functions to deal with qualitative and quantitative data, correlation/association, sampling functions, statistics tests and distributions examples and usability.

Plot data is important and in Python is good for that. Here, you'll find examples of how to build a bunch of plots using libs, like MatplotLib, Searbon and Plotly.\
Also, how to build a Dashboard using Plotly and general functions that help build all the plot environment.


## [R](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/tree/main/R)
 > Is a open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing

It is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself (partially self-hosting) and has a command line interface.\
Precompiled executables are provided for various operating systems, with multiple third-party graphical user interfaces are also available, such as RStudio and Jupyter.

First, you see two `.pdf` files, both are *Cheat Sheet*, very usefull when are dealing with [*Dplyr*](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/R/R-Dplyr-CheatSheet.pdf) or [*GGPlot2*](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/R/R-GGPlot2-CheatSheet.pdf) packages. And then, three `.md` files with language knowledege.

[**R.md**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/Languages/blob/main/R/R.md)\
