Subjects that I learn because of my professional life or that I was curious about it, so all gather all together, separated it into topics (Google Docs) and that is the result.


<center>All docx can be commented, so feel free to comment to update some mistake or to improve in some way. If you wanna add  or edit a topic, send me a email with the text that I will add it into the docx.</center>


First, let's list the docx related with computer and data science.
 - [**GDocs Database**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N15zdvKR0HRKpN2-1ssVOD1f-WOhe5q2fL3f_B8tAgc/edit?usp=sharing) data is important, but how to store is also important, here you can find some concepts, languages to query data and how to use some management systems.
   - Concepts: Columnar vs Row Oriented DB -- Data Warehouse/Lake -- RDBMS -- NoSQL
   - Query Languages: SQL -- Cypher
   - Management Systems: MySQL -- PostgreSQL -- MongoDB -- Neo4j
 - [**GDocs Data Concepts**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KqlPu863sH0eKOfvvY9fGQnhKmYzO8FdjfFtv5jI_MI/edit?usp=sharing) here has everything related with data that isn't in another docs, like Data Science Pipeline, Data Teams and Data Format.
   - Data Science Pipeline: Obtaining & Preprocessing Data -- Data Exploratory -- Interpreting & Modeling Data, Model Deploy and Revision
   - Data Temas: ETL -- ELT -- Data Ops
   - Data Format: Wide -- Long -- Parquet
 - [**GDocs Artificial Inteligence**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T_6BnLTSTsrSU-WsZ4i1ZD8CcJLRB29wwITiKDVg1JQ/edit?usp=sharing) knowledege about AI and Machine Learning, from concepts and fields to optimization and algorithms. The math part of some functions and methods are also descripted.
   - Concepts: Statistical Learning -- Prediction vs Inference -- Model Evaluation/Selection -- Hyperparameter Tuning -- Bias vs Variance
   - Fields: NLP -- Neural Networks -- Evolutionary Computation -- Vision/Robotics -- Speech Processing
   - Optimization: SGD (w/ Momentum) -- Normal Equation -- Regularization -- Ada Grad -- Lagrange Multipliers
   - Algorithm: Linear Regression -- Classification *Naive Bayes, Logistic Reg, Maximum Likelihood* -- Decision Trees -- SVM -- KNN -- KMeans -- DBSCAN -- Reinforcement Learning -- Feature Selection / Dimensionality Reduction -- Associate Rules -- Neural Network
   - Cases: Recommended System
 - [**GDocs Mathematics**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJGlxdmNn-jrmnmDoHGGQbHpkgvm2JkOQY-l9jk4Awo/edit?usp=sharing) because AI isn't magic, it's just math; so here you can find some math concepts.
   - Fundamentals: Algebra Properties -- Functions -- Polynomials -- Fundamental Theorem of Algebra -- Trigonometry -- Logarithm -- Complex Numbers
   - Graph Theory -- Linear Transformation -- Linear Systems
   - Vectors and Matrices properties, operations and more
   - Calculus: Limit -- Derivatives -- Integral
 - [**GDocs Statistics**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LGm6v2gzczZt8pEkbRh_W5SvcERKFtT-3Uoz54ILXzA/edit?usp=sharing) here you can understand how to see data, to extract hidden information and patterns - analyze it.
   - Concepts: Analysis Type -- Fields -- Observational Study and Experiments
   - Qualitative/Quantitative Variables -- Times Series -- Association/Correlation
   - Probability -- Information Theory -- Random Variable - Probability Distribution
   - Sampling -- Proportion -- Hypothesis Test -- Statistical Test -- Multivariate Analysis
   - Cases: Marketing Analysis


Here has the subjects that I was curious and want to know a little be more.\
*NOTE* I've a degree in Computer Science; I'm just a guy who likes other fields and wanna know more about it.
 - [**GDocs Curiosity**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qjjeoNa5ZzHHhmhOjQYl6yK9BATA9oVHT_KUQO_zkuw/edit?usp=sharing) fun and random topics - the only criteria used to chosen the topics was that I found them interesting
 - [**GDocs Biology**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aH-GYlbdnjTWsGwu4Z-d6S37l9xAeT4FUoEpt6kXHh8/edit?usp=sharing) because it is also important to learn about living things, they can give us great inspiration to code
 - [**GDocs Chemistry**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cMLBFiNFg6igFbHgXbLzSI1KharJda6pj78IPF9Jljc/edit?usp=sharing) I think it's cool to learn about how things are composed and their properties
 - [**GDocs Geograph**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mKCoENCC5d_yj8BV3tQtgdGBqXnYxxqhrsILttgCJwE/edit?usp=sharing) some say it's not a real science, I disagree, it's very useful and can be fun :)
 - [**GDocs Physics**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y8rosRFmUUZ64JlOO8K2bPCHh10ew5nA2pcILCWdGuk/edit?usp=sharing) always loved understand how things interact and influence each other
