# About myself

Hello, my name is Salomão *sɐlʊmˈə̃w* or you can call me Salomon, works too. I'm a undergraduate Computer Science by the Universidade Federal de Uberlândia *UFU*, located in Uberlândia, Brazil, finished in 2021/July. My main passions are: sports *watch or practice*, watch movies and anime, read manga or sci-fi books, learn new things and live the journey we call life.

I've worked a little in all areas of data science, first, as an intern at a freelance company, working with machine learning algorithms, NLP, dashboards, explanatory analysis, creating and maintaining ETL pipelines, as well as data cleaning (working with Python , aws, gcp) - which lasted about 5/6 months.

Then I changed companies, I worked for 1 and a half year with maintenance and creation of new features in ETL pipelines; Later, within the same company, I was transferred to the team that creates product queries, all of this development was done using the ECL language.\
Aligning with this last job, I focused on acquiring knowledge about statistics and mathematics (I took some courses, such as on the Data Science Academy portal, in addition to reading several blogs and books). Also, improve my knowledge in the computer area, by learning new computer languages, acquiring new techniques in already known languages and some important concepts. You can find more about in [**Knowledge**](https://salomaoalves.github.io/knowledge/) or [**Computer Languages**](https://github.com/salomaoalves/salomaoalves.github.io/blob/main/_includes/page_text/language.md).

I'm very good at adapting to uncomfortable situations/environments, where I don't have much knowledge and have to work hard; dig and hunt for answers. I like to always feel challenged, doing new things, that is, being challenged in different ways, constantly.

Now, I would like to talk a little more about my journey until here.
