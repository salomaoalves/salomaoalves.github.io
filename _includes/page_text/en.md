# About myself

Hello, my name is Salomão *sɐlʊmˈə̃w* or you can call me Salomon, works too. I'm a undergraduate Computer Science by the Universidade Federal de Uberlândia *UFU*, located in Uberlândia, Brazil, finished in 2021/July. My main passions are: sports *watch or practice*, watch movies and anime, read manga or sci-fi books, learn new things and live the journey we call life.

I've worked a little in all areas of data science, first, as an intern at a freelance company, working with machine learning algorithms, NLP, dashboards, explanatory analysis, creating and maintaining ETL pipelines, as well as data cleaning (working with Python, AWS, GCP) - which lasted about 5/6 months.

Then I graduated and switched companies; I worked for 1 and a half year with maintenance and creation of new features in ETL pipelines; later, in the same company, I was transferred to the team that creates product queries - a more developer job, all of this development was done using the ECL language. This company area is risk solution, creating products like Fraud Score and Identity Verification - it's called Lexis Nexis.\\
Aligning with this last job, I focused on acquiring knowledge about statistics and mathematics (I took some courses, such as on the Data Science Academy portal, in addition to reading several blogs and books). Also, improve my knowledge in the computer area, by learning new computer languages, acquiring new techniques in already known languages and some important concepts. You can find more about in [**Knowledge**](https://salomaoalves.github.io/knowledge/) or [**Computer Languages**](https://salomaoalves.github.io/prog_lang/).

I'm very good at adapting to uncomfortable situations/environments, where I don't have much knowledge and have to work hard; dig and hunt for answers. I like to always feel challenged, doing new things, that is, being challenged in different ways, constantly.


### My Journey
Now, I would like to talk a little more about my journey until here. I was born in 1998, in Unaí, a small city close to the Brazil capital, Brasilía. Since kid, I always like to learn how things are build and works, from machines to the nature itself, even how human behavior in relation to a certain activity (like its rules, history and so on), i.e., I'm a curious guy. I also always love math, see big equations being developed in a page, seeing each steps, the transforms; for me, there is a beauty in that - so, when I discover programming, I think I would love it, besides having no computer background. Like always, in the first, that wasn't the case.

I lived in Unaí until I was 15 years old, when I moved to Uberlândia to do High School in a bigger city. During this years, I had my first contact with programming, doing a 4-week training or something in UFU (which later it will be my university). After this first contact, I like programming but I decide to focus on study to get in college, which was done, entering in Computer Science, in 2017.

In college, my first year I learn C and Prolog and that wasn't good kkkk I had some difficult at the beginning and almost decide to quit and change degree, but in the deep I saw something that I maybe liked and want to give another try - by the half of the second year, I was loving it. I joined the PET (a governamental programming to estimulate search and extracurricular activities that complement academic training) and in there I found some people that gave energy and their own time to teach me, making my passional for programming real. Also, I discover Python, a languague with a syntax more confortable for humans, and with that I understand how programming works and how much I like it; in now days, when I have a more not-confortable language, is not that difficult - in the end, is just a algorithm, a set of steps, just like math.

With that, I knew that I like computer and that I want to work with something related, but what? Data Science, the field that put together mathematics/statistics, computer/programming, and also business areas knowledge. The first one I already liked since kid, the second I start to like during college and the third one, if you stop to think, is how human behavior in a certain activity, something I like too. Because of that, since college I like to spend time improving knowledge related to this three topics.

During college, I joined the PET, where I was able to teach some computer topics to younger students, make a reasearch in bioinformatics area and work with a big group *more than 10 people*. I also participated in lectures, meetings and other events. And some university games too, competing in sports such as volleyball and judo - sometimes even helping a little with the organization. My first intership and a student exchange to Egypt was also during college.

I finished college in 2021 and I already get a job - the same one I'm currently in. In 2022 I moved to São Paulo, always want to know how is to live here - I liked, and I'm still here. During this time, I being working for my full-time job, studying new topics (maintaing the Data Science job in mind), going out with friends, getting to know the city - basically, enjoying the journey.
