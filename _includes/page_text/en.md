# About myself
I've worked a little in all areas of data science, as an intern at a freelance company, working with
machine learning algorithms, NLP, dashboards, explanatory analysis, creating and maintaining ETL
pipelines, as well as data cleaning (working with Python , aws, gcp) - which lasted about 5/6
months.
Then I changed companies, I worked for 1 and a half years with maintenance and creation of new
features in ETL pipelines; Later, within the same company, I was transferred to the team that creates
product queries, all of this development was done using the ECL language. In these two years, in
addition to work, I focused on acquiring knowledge about statistics and mathematics (I took some
courses, such as on the Data Science Academy portal, in addition to reading several blogs and
books).
I'm very good at adapting to uncomfortable situations/environments, where I don't have much
knowledge and have to work hard; dig and hunt for answers. I like to always feel challenged, doing
new things, that is, being challenged in different ways, constantly.
